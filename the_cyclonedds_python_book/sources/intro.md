## About Eclipse Cyclone DDS

Eclipse Cyclone DDS is a very performant and robust open-source DDS implementation. Cyclone DDS is developed completely in the open as an [Eclipse IoT project](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.cyclonedds) with a growing list of [adopters](https://iot.eclipse.org/adopters/?#iot.cyclonedds). It is a tier-1 middleware for the Robot Operating System ROS 2.
