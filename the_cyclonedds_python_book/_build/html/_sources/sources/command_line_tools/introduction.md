# Command line tools

Installing the Cyclone DDS Python package will add two command line tools to your shell: [`ddsls`](tool-ddsls) and [`pubsub`](tool-pubsub). These help you to monitor and test your DDS applications. Secondly, a Python mode will be available on your existing [`idlc`](tool-idlc) executable from Cyclone DDS.
