    "\n",
    "There is no official mapping from IDL 4.2 to Python at the time of writing. However, Cyclone DDS Python implements (nearly) the full spec by leveraging Python metaclasses and typehints. By doing most of the hard work not in the IDL compiler but by runtime type inspection the generated code actually stays very close to a concept from the Python standard library called `dataclasses`, making it feasible to write types by hand directly in Python and skipping the IDL compiler alltogether, which is convinient when your DDS application is Python-only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not everything you can describe in IDL can be captured using basic Python types, and not every basic Python type can be interpreted as IDL. The [`cyclonedds.idl`](cyclonedds.idl) module contains everything needed to make a consistent mapping between the two.\n",

    "### Basic IDL Types\n",

    "While Python has only `int`, `str`, `float` and `bool` as relevant basic types in IDL there are integers and floats of varying byte sizes. To leverage these there is the [`cyclonedds.idl.types`](cyclonedds.idl.types) module which specifies these:"

Also, if you use the base Python `int` in your IDL definitions they will map to `int64` and `float` maps to `float64`. Only the background type inspection will note the byte sizes and use these when reading/writing data. For strings and bools you can use `str` and `bool` as normal.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python we are used to the `list` and `dict` as our primary datatypes. In IDL there are `sequence`, `array` and `map`, and arguably `bounded_string` is a collection too. Unlike their Python counterparts they are _strongly typed_, meaning that they can only contain items of a specific type. For example, a `sequence<int64>` maps seemlessly to a Python `List[int]` type hint, but the `List[Any]` is not something we can express in IDL. The `array` is something that is not expressable in normal Python type hints at all, fixed-length collections are not a thing in normal Python and using the Python standard library module `array` comes with its own caveats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we can import these types from [`cyclonedds.idl.types`](cyclonedds.idl.types) and use them in a way that is almost 1-to-1 with IDL. The `map` can simply be expressed as `typing.Dict`."
