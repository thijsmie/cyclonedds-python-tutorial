    "QoS stands for Quality of Service. In DDS you can apply a set of QoS policies to any entity, controlling the behaviour of the DDS system. DDS cannot know which data is critically important and which is actually irrelevant after a few seconds, so QoS allows you to tell DDS the meta-data around data delivery, lifetime and storage. All policies on the writer and reader side together form the \"contract\" that DDS will have to furfill. Here some user discretion is adviced: it is possible to cause incompatibilities between reader and writer with some of the QoS policies, creating a contract that is impossible for DDS to furfill.\n",

    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "> In Cyclone DDS Python the `Qos` object behaves almost like a tuple of `Policy`.\n",
    "> It is immutable but easy to construct. All policies are classes or singletons under the `Policy` object.\n",
    "> For example, \"a TransientLocal Durability policy taking no arguments\" would result in `Policy.Durability.TransientLocal` and\n",
    "> \"a deadline policy of 15 seconds\" would result in `Policy.Deadline(duration(seconds=15))`. To construct a `Qos` object\n",
    "> out of policies you simply pass them as arguments: `qos = Qos(policy1, policy2, ...)`.\n",
