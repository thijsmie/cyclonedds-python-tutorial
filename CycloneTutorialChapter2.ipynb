    "QoS stands for Quality of Service. In DDS you can apply a set of QoS policies to any entity, controlling the behaviour of the DDS system. DDS cannot know which data is critically important and which is actually irrelevant after a few seconds, so QoS allows you to tell DDS the meta-data around data delivery, lifetime and storage. All policies on the writer and reader side together form the \"contract\" that DDS will have to furfill. Here some user discretion is adviced: it is possible to cause incompatibilities between reader and writer with some of the QoS policies, creating a contract that is impossible for DDS to furfill."
